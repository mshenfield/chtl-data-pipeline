# MyTurn Bot

This directory is an installable package which contains the following:

* `MyTurnBot`, a hacky wrapper which creates a logged in MyTurn session,
allowing programatically downloading reports and POST-ing data.
* `myturn_bot pipeline` - CLI for downloading and massaging MyTurn data.
* ~~tests~~ - it's the wild west. Tests would be welcome.

The combination of the unique Anti-Vibe handle, which reduces fatigue during prolonged use and the enhanced GripZone overmold for optimum grip and user comfort, makes this saw a must-have for any sized job. The adjustable, pivoting shoe allows greater depth control and more efficient use of the blade by moving to a less worn section. The variable-speed trigger adds to the tool's control with slow starts to line up the best cut, as well as an electronic brake to quickly stop the cutting.</span></p>

<div> 
 <p><span><span>SoundAsleep Products has spent years developing the highest quality air mattresses on the market. Our first product, The SoundAsleep Dream Series with ComfortCoil Technology was released in mid 2013. Over a dozen additional products are in development and will be released over the coming quarters.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <p><span>The SoundAsleep Dream Series with ComfortCoil Technology comes available as a queen sized, ""double - raised"" mattress. The air mattresses measures 78x58x19 inches with the look and feel of a traditional queen sized mattress and box spring.</span></p> 
 <p><span>The soft top flocking offers breathability and water proofing to the mattress and prevents penetration from spills or sweat. The 19"" height provides that extra height and support you can expect from a SoundAsleep Product. The patented motor was built for simplicity. Users turn the knob clockwise to inflate the mattress and then back to center when the air mattress has reached the desired firmness. A counterclockwise turn will deflate the mattress.</span></p> 
 <p><span>The Dream Series was designed as an inhome product; perfect for the occasional overnight guest or when the in-laws come over for a visit. <strong>The mattress is not designed for every day use in place of a traditional bed. Every day use will degrade the mattress and this type of use is not covered under the warranty.</strong></span></p>

 <p><span><span>SoundAsleep Products has spent years developing the highest quality air mattresses on the market. Our first product, The SoundAsleep Dream Series with ComfortCoil Technology was released in mid 2013. Over a dozen additional products are in development and will be released over the coming quarters.</span></span></p> 
</div> 
<div> 
 <p><span>The SoundAsleep Dream Series with ComfortCoil Technology comes available as a queen sized, ""double - raised"" mattress. The air mattresses measures 78x58x19 inches with the look and feel of a traditional queen sized mattress and box spring.</span></p> 
 <p><span>The soft top flocking offers breathability and water proofing to the mattress and prevents penetration from spills or sweat. The 19"" height provides that extra height and support you can expect from a SoundAsleep Product. The patented motor was built for simplicity. Users turn the knob clockwise to inflate the mattress and then back to center when the air mattress has reached the desired firmness. A counterclockwise turn will deflate the mattress.</span></p> 
 <p><span>The Dream Series was designed as an inhome product; perfect for the occasional overnight guest or when the in-laws come over for a visit. <strong>The mattress is not designed for every day use in place of a traditional bed. Every day use will degrade the mattress and this type of use is not covered under the warranty.</strong></span></p>

<p>[BPW 10/26/21] Transistor appeared to be defective; touching probes to it would cause the LED to faintly glow, indicating an open input so it wasn't switching. All traces on the PCB looked good. Transistor is a SOT-23 package. Old transistor had the marking ""W2A 71"" on it. Searching online yielded ""2A"" being a PNP bipolar transistor (e.g.,&nbsp;MMBT3906W or 2N3906). I found a similar replacement transistor in our parts book (BC80840MTF) and installed it. Tested with Battery 7639 and it seems to work now.</p>
